CHATGPT CODE RANKING: 7/10

parts where challenging, here are some things I need to improve on:

1. I feel my solution for the code wasnt the best. It worked but took many more lines then neccessary. 
2. Comments
3. planning my solution out better

Things I got better at:

1. Problem solving
2. Use of while loops
3. varible names
